# Formula 1 data analysis application

This is a project that aims to learn to do some datascience on real project et doing a maximum of different tasks
It will help me to do a real project and to link two of my passions, so I can stay on this project for a long time

## 2022

It is the first season I do. I searched an interesting data source, I scrap these data, do some processing and then make a visualisation and an analyse.

I made the graphs and charts that seems interesting for these data and I've added some updates during the year

Unfortunately, some of the data and graphs are useless because they depend too much on the circuit (speed and lap time).

End of 2022, I started thinking of what I want to do for the 2023 season and which would be better than what I did on the previous season.

It allowed me to do some plans with the avalaible data, the graphs and charts adapted  and the processing I have to do
